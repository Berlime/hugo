      <description>When I was 16, I launched my blog site with blogpost.com (now blogger.com).&#xA;You say why I blog? Well before this, I didn’t mange to get a hold of a computer. So what I did is, write a journal but wouldn’t call it a journal.&#xA;You see, the way I did it was to write in a ‘magazine’ look and format where there will be so called “ads” for the stuff I find interesting.</description>

      <description>Original Post date: 19th June 2024.&#xA;I live in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Specifically, Western part of Johor. Near Legoland Malaysia. In my area, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much groceries store around, there about 6 supermarkets nearby (at least 10 - 30mins). Further than that, I do not consider it nearby.&#xA;6 supermarkets may sound a lot for some. But not to me because most of them sell the same things. Say for an example, I could not find any natural sea salt in most of the super market.</description>

A funnel is basically a terminology used to generate leads. It is basically a way to filter through visitors or people that captures their attention into your business. A way of getting leads is to filter out the people through a funnel.&#xA;So, Tofu is exactly how it sounds like.</description>

      <description>Original Post date: 13th May 2024&#xA;Ever since my late mom bought the house I currently live in, it is still in the original, unadorned state. My late mom did not opt for any renovations or even fancy decorations and pieces of furniture.&#xA;The only thing that my mom did was the kitchen cabinet and countertop which was not included when we got this house.&#xA;Oh yeah, we got it first-hand, brand new back in around 2014.</description>
